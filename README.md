Some useful routines

## KS_Spearman.py:
Two sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and Spearman rank correlation coefficient tests
The significance of each test is estimated by performing bootstrap sampling simulations and constructing 100,000 random same-size samples from the initial distribution. I have assigned two-tail p-values based on the results of these simulations.
